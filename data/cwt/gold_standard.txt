# Where will AGI affect last
AGI will hit the trades and artisanal professions last, especially those valued for their aesthetic quality, prestige, and personal touch. Even when artisans use AI tools, they will likely maintain their role as orchestrators, providing a uniquely human interface.

# Legal pushback
AI will face the strongest legal pushpack in healthcare, due to data standards and laws around protection for the users of the AI.

# AI in government
Uptake will be fastest in the areas associated with national security, it is however much less certain what uptake will be like in areas separate from national security.

# Political pushback
High chance of a reactionary political movement which attempts to add protections for jobs from AI. A postive outlook on this is to view the job protection as some kind of political bargain so you can have AI elsewhere. In the same way that you have a welfare state and free trade.

# AI teddy bears
It is desirable to have something that can feed your child's curiosity just as you would want your child to interact with other young children. However, it's important to ensure your child doesn't spend time exclusively with the AI teddy bear at the expense of socializing with real children. Another concern is that you may have too much surveillance over your kid. It is double-edged, you may not unnecessarily interfere with your child as much because you can do the audit via the AI. On the other hand, you may end up making a scene out of something which appears shocking but if left alone will actually be just fine. And end up exposing the child to unnecessary situations of anxiety which can have a negative effects. 

# Economics of media
If you can always just read an AI digest of the news, this will surely affect the status quo. We have just undergone a transformation with the online ad market where value came from getting as many views as possible, meaning journalists writing popular content (e.g., articles about Justin Bieber) indirectly subsidized coverage of less popular topics. With AI, it is hard to predict what will happen. It's possible we'll see a shift toward content created by charismatic individuals who provide relatable, human-curated experiences.
