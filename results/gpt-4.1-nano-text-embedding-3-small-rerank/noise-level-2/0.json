    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Economic impact of AI and trade:** Discussions highlight that AI and technological changes are significantly affecting the economy, with particular emphasis on trades such as electricians, plumbing, and gardening. There is a recognition that AI could lead to large economic shifts, possibly requiring protective measures for workers.\n\n- **Welfare state and free trade:** A recurring theme suggests that a generous welfare state acts as a \"bargain\" for enabling free trade, especially for service workers. This system provides workers with economic security and a sense of purpose, compensating for job disruptions.\n\n- **Protection and legal measures:** There is considerable focus on the potential need for legal and policy safeguards, such as laws to protect jobs amid AI disruption. Governments and large corporations may implement regulations to preserve employment, with some opposition from established industries like law due to high profit motives.\n\n- **Trade-offs and human face in trades:** The importance of maintaining a human element in trades last, preventing the complete automation of artisanal and service roles. This involves balancing technological advancement with preserving human employment and societal values.\n\n- **Public and political response:** Anticipated political movements aiming to protect employment through legislation, possibly including widespread resistance from powerful sectors. Governments could act swiftly—possibly faster than expected—to implement protections, reflecting a proactive approach to economic transitions.\n\n- **Humanity and societal values:** Concerns about surveillance trade-offs, signals of ongoing public debate about privacy, human rights, and the humane treatment of workers.\n\n- **Media, journalism, and subsidy models:** Mention of cross-subsidies in journalism (e.g., Substack) and news media, highlighting ongoing discussions about sustaining journalism as part of societal infrastructure, paralleling debates about economic support systems.\n\n- **Trade last, human face:** Emphasizes that despite automation and economic changes, maintaining a human presence and face-to-face interactions remains critical, both economically and socially.",
