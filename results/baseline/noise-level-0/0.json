    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes from Meeting\n\n- **Trades Last, Human Face**  \n  AGI is predicted to affect most sectors, but the artisanal trades such as electricians, plumbing, gardening, and certain human-mediated commerce roles are expected to be impacted last. There remains a strong preference for human involvement in relationship-based deals, especially those involving large pools of capital.\n\n- **Legal Pushback in Healthcare**  \n  Healthcare is likely to face strong legal resistance against the adoption of strong AGI systems due to issues like personal data handling and existing stringent standards that may need to evolve. This sector could be protected by laws analogous to those currently governing professions like medicine and law.\n\n- **Fast Uptake in Defense and Established Companies**  \n  While some government sectors may adapt quickly to AI, large established companies might exhibit significant resistance or pushback in adopting strong AGI, particularly in areas that could affect their workforce substantially.\n\n- **Unions and Bargaining Power**  \n  There is a high chance of political movements or unions emerging to protect a significant portion of existing jobs through regulatory means, potentially aiming to secure bargaining power and protect worker rights amid economic changes driven by AI.\n\n- **Teddy Bears, Surveillance Trade-off**  \n  There is an underlying trade-off involving surveillance and privacy concerns as AI adoption progresses, which reflects broader societal bargains similar to those seen in welfare states, balancing efficiency and social acceptance.\n\n- **News, Journalism, Cross Subsidy, Humanity, Substack**  \n  Journalism and news sectors face unique challenges where AI may alter how content is generated and funded. There is discussion about the persistence of human elements and the role of platforms like Substack, indicating a potential cross-subsidy model to sustain humanity-centered content creation.",
