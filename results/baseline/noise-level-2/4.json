    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades and Human Face**  \n  Trades such as electricians, plumbing, gardening, and other artisanal jobs will be among the sectors where AGI adoption will come last. These roles often require direct human interaction, negotiation, and alignment, preserving the human face in economic activities.\n\n- **Legal Pushback in Healthcare**  \n  Healthcare is expected to see strong legal protections against full AGI automation due to privacy concerns surrounding personal data and established regulatory standards. There is a high chance of political movements aimed at protecting many jobs in healthcare through laws analogous to those in medicine.\n\n- **Fast Uptake Defense**  \n  Larger companies and governments may show resistance to rapid AGI adoption in critical areas, potentially moving faster than anticipated in regulating and controlling the technology to protect economic stability and workers.\n\n- **Role of Unions and Bargaining**  \n  Worker protections and unions may play a significant role in shaping the transition to more automated economies, potentially bargaining for safeguards and fair deals that ensure meaningful employment and welfare for service workers.\n\n- **Teddy Bears and Surveillance Trade-Off**  \n  The analogy of “teddy bears” alludes to the trade-off society faces between comfort/security and surveillance or privacy losses as technology advances. There is a delicate balance to maintain humanity and privacy amidst increasing AI-driven surveillance.\n\n- **News, Journalists, and Cross-Subsidy**  \n  Journalism faces unique challenges as AI impacts the economics of news production. New models, including platforms like Substack, suggest cross-subsidies and alternative funding mechanisms may support journalistic integrity and humanity in reporting despite AI automation pressures.\n\n- **Welfare State Parallel**  \n  The ongoing AI-driven economic transformations evoke comparisons to welfare state models, where protection and support systems are essential to maintaining meaningful employment and social stability even in the face of automation-driven wealth gains.\n\nThese points reflect a nuanced perspective on the evolving interaction between AGI technology, legal frameworks, worker rights, and societal values. The aim remains to preserve human meaning in work while responsibly integrating AI.",
