The discussion highlighted that traditional trades (e.g., electricians, plumbers) may preserve jobs better due to their artisanal nature, yet will still undergo transformation.\n  \n- **Political Movements**: Anticipation of political movements aimed at protecting certain human jobs due to the rapid advancements in AI.
