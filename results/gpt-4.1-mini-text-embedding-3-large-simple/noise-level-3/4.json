    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades as Last Stronghold of Human Work**  \n  The artisanal and highly skilled trades (e.g., electricians, plumbers, gardeners) are expected to be among the last domains where human work remains crucial. These roles combine both technical skill and a \"human face,\" which cannot easily be replaced by AI.\n\n- **Legal and Political Pushback in Protecting Jobs**  \n  There is a significant chance of political movements aiming to legally protect a portion of human jobs, potentially freezing them bureaucratically in response to rapid technological change. This is analogous to existing laws but complicated by the fast, powerful impact of AI.\n\n- **Rapid Uptake and National Security Implications**  \n  AI adoption, especially in defense and national security sectors, is expected to be fast and significant. Governments might act as major AI adopters, despite legacy systems, to maintain security advantages.\n\n- **Role of Unions and Bargaining Power**  \n  With economic shifts and AI's impact on jobs, unions might play a critical role in bargaining for workers’ rights and protections as the labor market evolves.\n\n- **Surveillance Trade-offs and Privacy Concerns**  \n  The metaphor of “teddy bears” was used to highlight trade-offs between surveillance and personal freedoms. Increased monitoring may arise as part of economic transitions and AI integration.\n\n- **News and Journalism Economics**  \n  Journalism faces challenges as funding models shift; cross-subsidization (e.g., via platforms like Substack) could be important to preserve the humanity and integrity of news dissemination amid evolving media landscapes.",
