    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades and Artisanal Jobs:**  \n  Trades such as electricians, plumbers, and gardeners, particularly the high-skilled, artisanal parts, are expected to be among the last to be automated or replaced by AI. These jobs often carry a \"human face\" element that remains valued economically and socially.\n\n- **Legal and Political Pushback in Healthcare and Other Sectors:**  \n  There is a significant likelihood of political movements aiming to legally protect a portion of human jobs, especially in bureaucratic and regulated domains such as healthcare. This may manifest as efforts to \"freeze\" jobs on paper to manage the fast pace of technological change and its societal impact.\n\n- **Fast Uptake in Defense and Related Areas:**  \n  Certain sectors, like defense, are anticipated to adopt AI and automation rapidly due to strategic incentives, potentially leading to swift economic and labor market adjustments.\n\n- **Role of Unions and Bargaining:**  \n  Unions and collective bargaining could play an important role in negotiating protections or transitions for workers impacted by AI-driven changes in the labor market.\n\n- **Surveillance and Privacy Trade-offs:**  \n  The deployment of technology such as surveillance tools (metaphorically referenced as \"teddy bears\") involves trade-offs between security and privacy, reflecting tensions that arise as societies adapt to new technologies.\n\n- **Media, Journalism, and Economic Sustainability:**  \n  News organizations and journalists may face economic challenges. Cross-subsidization models (e.g., through platforms like Substack) emerge as strategies to sustain journalistic work while maintaining humanity and integrity in an evolving economic environment.\n\n- **Welfare State and Economic Transition:**  \n  A generous and adaptable welfare state is considered necessary to support workers through economic transformations caused by AI. While it may not always be the most efficient model, it serves as an acceptable bargain to maintain societal stability.\n\n- **Human-Centered Jobs and Service Sector:**  \n  Some desk-bound, service-oriented jobs that require interpersonal interaction, alignment, and negotiation (e.g., council work, certain types of sales) may be resistant to automation and remain human-centric for longer.\n\nThese points reflect key themes on how AI and automation influence labor dynamics, political and legal responses, economic sustainability of media, and the role of social welfare systems.",
