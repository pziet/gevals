    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades and Artisanal Jobs**\n  - Trades such as electricians, plumbing, and gardening are seen as some of the last areas where human work will persist amidst AI advancements.\n  - These roles often have a \"human face\" and high-status, high-skilled components that make them uniquely resistant to full automation.\n  - Such trades may evolve but maintain the need for personal interaction and craftsmanship.\n\n- **Legal and Political Pushback in Healthcare and Employment**\n  - There is a strong likelihood of political movements aiming to freeze or protect a significant portion of human jobs through bureaucratic means, especially in response to rapid AI-driven changes.\n  - These efforts may manifest as legal pushbacks particularly in sensitive sectors like healthcare.\n  - This resistance reflects concerns over the pace of change and its societal impacts.\n\n- **Fast Uptake in Defense Sector**\n  - The defense sector is anticipated to adopt AI and automation rapidly given the national security implications.\n  - This fast uptake suggests a strategic priority placed on advanced technology in defense compared to other sectors.\n\n- **Unions and Bargaining**\n  - There is an ongoing discussion about the role of unions and collective bargaining as a mechanism to negotiate the terms of work in an AI-augmented economy.\n  - Unions may be pivotal in safeguarding workersâ€™ rights as jobs change or disappear.\n\n- **Surveillance and Trade-offs (Teddy Bears Metaphor)**\n  - The metaphor of \"teddy bears\" refers to the surveillance trade-offs workers and society might face, balancing privacy with the efficiencies and safety AI provides in workplaces.\n  - This highlights the ethical and social dilemmas inherent in AI integration.\n\n- **Journalism, News, and Cross-Subsidy**\n  - Journalism faces unique challenges with AI, including funding and preserving humanity in news reporting.\n  - New models like Substack are emerging, helping journalists sustain their work through cross-subsidies and direct audience support.\n  - Maintaining the human element in reporting remains a priority despite technological transformations.",
