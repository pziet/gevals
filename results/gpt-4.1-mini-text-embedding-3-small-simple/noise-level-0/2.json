    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades and Human Interaction:**  \n  Advanced AI is expected to affect trades and artisanal jobs such as electricians, plumbing, and gardening last. These trades involve human mediation and personal relationships that people strongly prefer, especially when it comes to commerce and large pools of capital.\n\n- **Legal and Regulatory Pushback in Healthcare:**  \n  Healthcare is likely to face strong legal resistance due to the complexities of handling personal data and existing standards. These standards will require significant adjustments to accommodate AI advancements, potentially delaying AI integration in healthcare sectors.\n\n- **Fast Uptake in Defense and Government Sectors:**  \n  There is discussion about where AI adoption might come last, with some thinking government might be slow, but it could move faster than expected. However, large established companies may show strong resistance in certain areas.\n\n- **Unions and Worker Protections:**  \n  There is a high possibility of political movements emerging to protect jobs from strong AI, analogous to existing laws in law and medicine sectors. This could involve unions bargaining for worker rights amidst AI-induced economic changes.\n\n- **Trade-offs with Surveillance and Privacy:**  \n  The integration of more AI and surveillance technologies may lead to trade-offs reminiscent of \"teddy bears\" where people weigh comfort and security against privacy concerns.\n\n- **Media, Journalism, and Economic Subsidies:**  \n  The role of journalists, particularly with a humanities background, raises questions about cross-subsidy models in news and media. Platforms like Substack exemplify new economic models aiming to preserve the humanity and quality of journalism in the AI era.\n\n- **Welfare State and Economic Transition:**  \n  There is discussion on the necessity of a generous welfare state to maintain acceptance of free trade and support workers during economic transitions caused by AI. This welfare state may serve as a bargain or support system for service workers impacted by AI-driven change.",
