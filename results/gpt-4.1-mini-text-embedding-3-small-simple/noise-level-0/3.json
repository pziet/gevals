    "enhancedNotes": "# Enhanced Notes\n\n- **Trades as Last to be Affected by AGI:**  \n  Certain artisanal trades, such as electricians, plumbers, and gardeners, are expected to be among the last sectors significantly impacted by advanced AI. These trades rely heavily on human interaction and physical execution, which AI cannot easily replace. People tend to prefer commerce and deals mediated by human proxies, especially where large pools of capital are involved.\n\n- **Human Element in Trade and Commerce:**  \n  There is a strong human preference for maintaining personal interaction in trade and commerce, particularly in high-stakes transactions conducted by representatives of large institutions. The \"human face\" remains an important factor.\n\n- **Legal Pushback and Regulation in Healthcare:**  \n  Healthcare is likely to encounter strong legal resistance to AI integration. This stems from stringent standards around handling personal data, regulatory frameworks, and privacy concerns. Changes to these standards will be necessary as AI advances. The healthcare sector's legal frameworks may act as significant obstacles for AI’s widespread adoption.\n\n- **Fast Uptake in Defense and Other Sectors:**  \n  While some sectors resist, defense and perhaps government-related areas might see faster AI adoption than expected, driven by institutional and organizational needs.\n\n- **Unions and Worker Bargaining Power:**  \n  There is potential for political and labor movements to push for protections or bargaining agreements to safeguard jobs against automation by strong AI. This reflects a broader trend where social safety nets and welfare states balance the disruptions caused by free trade and technology.\n\n- **Trade-offs Between Surveillance and Privacy (\"Teddy Bears\" Metaphor):**  \n  Discussions acknowledge the trade-offs between increased surveillance enabled by AI and individual privacy. This metaphor may represent the acceptance of some level of monitoring in exchange for benefits, possibly in security or healthcare.\n\n- **Impact on Journalism and Media Economics:**  \n  Journalists may experience a cross-subsidy effect, where AI tools affect their workflows and economic models, pushing them toward new platforms like Substack. There is a concern about preserving the humanity and quality of journalism in the face of automation and AI-generated news.\n\nOverall, the conversation highlights the nuanced economic, social, and legal dynamics shaping AI’s integration into various sectors, balancing efficiency gains with human elements, legal frameworks, and societal values.",
